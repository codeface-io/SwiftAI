# LLM APIs

This overview is based on a converstation with Grok 2 on November 11, 2024.

LLM providers offering web APIs, sorted by their estimated maximum performance in deep reasoning capabilities, based on available evaluations, benchmarks, and general perception in the AI community:

1. **Grok-2 (xAI)**
   - **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Outperformed Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4-Turbo on LMSYS leaderboard, indicating strong deep reasoning abilities.
   - **Unique Features**: Access to real-time data from X posts, which might enhance its reasoning in contexts requiring current information.
2. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)**
   - **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Top performer in various reasoning tasks, known for its high-quality responses and nuanced understanding.
   - **Unique Features**: Strong emphasis on ethical AI and alignment with human values, which indirectly influences its reasoning by considering broader impacts.
3. **GPT-4 (OpenAI)**
   - **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Historically one of the leaders in reasoning tasks before newer models like Claude 3.5 and Grok-2 emerged. Still very strong.
   - **Unique Features**: Offers diverse model sizes and capabilities, including multimodal inputs, which can aid in complex reasoning tasks.
5. [**Command R+ (Cohere)**](https://cohere.com)

   - **Unique Features**: Part of Google's broader AI ecosystem, potentially integrating with Google's vast data resources.
7. [**Mistral**](https://mistral.ai)
   - **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Not often highlighted in benchmarks for reasoning specifically, but Mistral's focus on ethical AI might imply careful reasoning processes.
   - **Unique Features**: Emphasis on ethical considerations, which might influence the depth of reasoning to ensure fairness and transparency.
8. [**Llama 3.2 (Meta AI)**](https://www.llama.com)
   - **Reasoning Benchmark Performance**: Open-source nature allows for community-driven advancements in reasoning, but performance might vary based on how it's fine-tuned or used.
   - **Unique Features**: Open-source, which can lead to diverse applications and community improvements in reasoning capabilities.

**Notes:**

- This list is based on interpretations of performance from various sources, including general benchmarks, research papers, and developer feedback. The exact ranking might vary as new models get released or as existing models are updated.
- Open-source models like Falcon and Llama-3 and custom models could be accessed by
  - hosting them on [Huggin Face](https://huggingface.co)
  - hosting them on [Replicate](https://replicate.com)
  - using providers who already host them
