The meaning of life varies greatly depending on individual beliefs, philosophies, and cultural backgrounds. Here are a few perspectives:

- **Philosophical:** To find personal purpose or happiness.
- **Religious/Spiritual:** Often involves fulfilling a divine plan or achieving enlightenment.
- **Existential:** Life has no inherent meaning; individuals must create their own.
- **Biological:** To survive and reproduce.
